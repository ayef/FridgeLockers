IMPORTANT
=========
We have changed where we host our code! We love GitHub, but in order to easily conglomerate our various repositories and issue tracking software, we have moved our code hosting to http://bitbucket.sensorcon.com/

Please go there for the latest updates to our code!


This is a simple example app to show you how to get your own Sensordrone app up and running.

Please use the comments in the source code as a guide.

The library file needed has been included in the /libs directory, as well,
so you shouldn't need to download anything extra.

Note: The latest version of this library can always be found at https://github.com/Sensorcon/Sensordrone


An example of importing this project into eclipse will be added later.
